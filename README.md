# Student-Management-Tool 
-   <a href="http://kate.ict.op.ac.nz/~warnaa1/Projects/SMT/">Student-Management-Tool link</a> 
-	Created a Student Admin tool for lectures of the IT school at Otago Polytechnic, to be used as a student feedback mechanism
-	Developed in PHP, Bootstrap, HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, MariaDB
-	Upkeep of the website and fix any issues or make repairs
-	Upgraded after feedback was received and have expanded into 2 other schools due to the success of the tool
- Please note, I have uploaded Two files(HTML and a Controller) which uploads CSV Files to a Directory, the code will do the following:
    - This file Uploads new students from CSV File
    - This file edits the deliminters and replace them with a standard deliminter
    - Once reset the button is pressed, the tables are dropped and previous student information is deleted and new tables are populated.
    - New Student infromation is read in from CSV
