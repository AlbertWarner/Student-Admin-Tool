# Student-Admin-Tool 
-   <a href="smt.op-bit.nz">Student-Admin-Tool link</a> 
-	Created a Student Admin tool for lectures of the IT school at Otago Polytechnic, to be used as a student feedback mechanism
-	PHP, Bootstrap, HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, MariaDB
-	Upkeep of the website and fix any issues or make repairs
-	Upgraded after feedback was received and have expansion plans into other schools due to the success of the tool
- Please note, I have uploaded one php file which uploads CSV File Directory, to show some of the code
    - This file Uploads new students from CSV File
    - This file edits the deliminters and replace them with a standard deliminter
    - Once reset the button is pressed, the previous student information is deleted.
